Hi Rein.
How's it going!

This project started out really well, it always takes me awhile to understand
the instructions properly as I like to complicate things! Anyway, it was going
ok, i passed section 1 in no time and section 2, I had read the expectations and
made some notes on paper, and researched somethings etc, and I thought i was on
top of it. But then I hit a wall and never recovered! Section 2 is mostly complete,
I still haven't figured out what is wrong with the things that are wrong. I didn't
really understand how to use the splice method.
Anyway, I moved on to section 3.
That was going well but then i kept getting weird errors and I am going to
have to stop now,
it's nearly time to hand it in.
I did my best. I hit some problems and google took me down a dark hole of no
return!
See you tomorrow!
